# UFOs

## Overview of Project
In this project we were told to create a webpage for Dana. Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. By adding these filters, we can allow the viewer to narrow down the data to exactly what they would like to see. 
## Results
In this project we added a few filters, which we will explain to Dana below.
1. Enter Date: Within this first criteria, the user can enter an exact date to see if any UFO sightings happened on those days. It allows the user to specify a certain time frame to look at.
2. Enter a City: This narrows down the geographic area for the user. If the user intends to look at sightings within a certain area, they can choose a city and see if there was any sightings in that specific city.
3. Enter a State: Similar to above, but allows for a broader analysis by narrowing down by exact states.
4. Enter a Country: Similar to the two above, if you want an even broader lense, the user can look at all sightings in a specific country if needed.
5. Shape: If the user is looking for a specific type of ufo, shape is the category to narrow down. It states what shape ufo the sightings had, and allows the user to analyze similar UFO types.

## Summary

### Drawback
With this design, there will always be potential drawbacks. One specific drawback with this design is we have a comments section, but we can't narrow down by specific keywords within those comments. For example, say people said they saw a bright green light. This would be added to the comments section. Yet we don't have a way to narrow down by specific keywords, so we could not compare bright green light sightins in a simple way.

### Recommendations
1. Allow the user to search by specific key words over the whole page. As stated above, the comment section has no filter added.
2. Similar to the above recommendation, we have no filter for duration. Someone might be looking to compare sightings with similar durations to see any similarity.
   An additional filter for duration time (possibly in the state of min: X to max: Y) could help.
